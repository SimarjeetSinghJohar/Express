# Express Robust Chat Application 
Created a basic but robust chat Web-application. In this application we can post a message and have it automatically synchronised across several different browsers using Socket.io with automatic notifications and updates.
Also, database frameworks and providers such as mLabs were looked upon in this app using MongoDB. The application was built using asynchronous functionalities such Callbacks, promises , async/await  etc. in Node.js
